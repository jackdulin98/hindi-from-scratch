  <p>Modals are words that express possibility, intent, ability, or necessity. The most typical examples found in the English language are can, could, may, might, shall, 
should, will, would, and must. Less common examples are ought, had better, dare, and need. But let's say we want to know how to say "I might meet Raveena tomorrow." First, 
we will start with basic examples of the construct "I might ..."</p>

  <table>
    <th>English</th>
    <th>Hindi</th>
    <th>Devanagari</th>
    <tr>
      <td>I might go.</td>
      <td>Main ja sakta hoon.</td>
      <td>---</td>
    </tr>
    <!-- figure out how to indent multiple lines in Notepad at once -->
    <tr>
    <td>I might eat.</td>
    <td>Main kha sakta hoon.</td>
    <td>---</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>I might run.</td>
    <td>Main daud sakta hoon.</td>
    <td>---</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Now, we're ready to say the big sentence. The infinitive form of the word "meet" in Hindi is "milnaa" and it's used with "se." Using this information, we are able to
  gather the Hindi form of the sentence "I might meet Raveena tomorrow" comes out as "Main kal Raveena se mil sakta hoon."
