short website session: make a header that doesn't scroll instead of the one that takes up the whole 
	screen, since that's pretty ugly (have it formatted similarly to the Wayback Machine)
if you want comments within the style tag, probably best to use the /* */ format
link the second page to the third one we have created, first one is already linked
when you're pushing your commits to the repository, you can now use (only after creating the remote origin):
git push origin main
in order to center some text within an element, use:
text-align: center;
can't wait to learn about flexbox, one of the CSS units on the Odin Project
possible ways of keeping a static heading, as per StackOverflow: using frame-sets and iframes, but they're not user-friendly enough?
consider position: sticky; which seems like it's one of the more updated versions, as of 2021
the old-fashioned solution is something like: 
#header {
	position: fixed;
}
#content {
	margin-top: 100px;
}
