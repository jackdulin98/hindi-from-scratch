  <h1>Time</h1>
  <p>Time is what helps us stay on schedule, so that we don't miss the bus or that important deadline at work.</p>
  <p>Let's start by going back to our primary school roots and cover the days of the week.</p>
  <!-- Do the days of the week typically get capitalized in Hindi? -->
  <!-- How do you say "and then" in Hindi? -->
  <!-- Want to eventually be able to have a forum section ... we'll get to that. -->
  <!-- For each day of the week, put in an audio recording of your voice so it can't be copyrighted and you get additional practice. -->
  <!-- Include the phrase for "what does <word> mean?" -->
  <!-- Have a quiz at the end of each lesson. -->
  <!-- Go over how to design a table: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_table_borders.asp -->
  <!-- regularly push this code to Github repo and to the website -->

  While we're on the topic of days, you might also want to know the ordinal numbers in Hindi. For instance, you want to say "Ansh's birthday is on the 13th of August."
  In Hindi, this would be expressed as "Ansh ki janmadin terahavaan agast ko hai." As you may have noticed, the months in Hindi are very similar to the months in English. 
  We will still cover them later. Here's a table of the first 20 ordinals in Hindi.
  </p>
  <!-- How do you center the text in a table cell? -->
  <!-- Answer: do not use the text-align attribute in the table tag, since HTML5 has deprecated it. Use the CSS attribute instead. -->
  <!-- Question for another day: how do you center the table in the middle of the page? -->
  <!-- Also, how do you separate the median so it doesn't look heterogeneous? --> 
  <!-- Dandas are used to mark the end of a sentence, but when is a double danda used? --> 
  <!-- My renditions will be a bit more literal than a native speaker's, as I am a white boy who learned it from scratch at age 22. -->
  <!-- IDEA: Create an interactive calendar with all the ordinals. -->
  <!-- We will make the learning process very repetitive, this is done on purpose. -->

  For the first ordinal, you might recognize that the pronunciation is a bit non-intuitive. It sounds like "pehela" instead of "pahala." This phenomenon also 
  occurs for similar words like "sister" in English, which translates to "bahan" in Hindi but sounds like "behen." Ask more about this one.
  </p>
  <p>
  Next, let's go over how to tell the time. A common mistake most learners (including myself) might make is assuming that the English translation for 
  "what time is it?" is "samay kya hai?" Our intuitions lead us astray here, because the literal English translation for the question in Hindi is 
  "how many chimes?" In Hindi, this would be "kitne baje hai?"
  </p>
  <!-- I tried to render angular brackets, but it wouldn't take. How do you actually write those in HTML? -->
  <p>
  Now of course, you're not going to want to look like a deer in headlights when someone asks you this. So, here's the general answer you would use in most cases: "(number) baje hai/hain." Notice I said
  "most cases." This is because half-past-one and half-past-two have their own special cases, since they're so special. Let's go over a few basic examples.
